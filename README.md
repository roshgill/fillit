# fillit
Algorithm that fits tetromino pieces together to occupy the smallest possible space

- Created syntax checker that validates tetrominos (Tetris pieces) for required syntax and shape
- Developed a function to determine the smallest square map based on input
- Developed recursion algorithm to iterate until all pieces fit into the smallest possible square map (If tetrominos (Tetris pieces) donâ€™t fit, map size increases by 1)
- Utilized: Recursion, Text File Input, Programmed in C Using Visual Studio Code, LLDB Debugger, Header File, Pointer Manipulation, 2-Dimensional Array Structure, Libft Functions

Type 'make' to compile files.

Type "./fillit ./tetrominofiles/tet1.txt" to run program (also can use tet2.txt or tet3.txt)
